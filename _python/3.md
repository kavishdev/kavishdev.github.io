# Session 3
## Introduction
In this session the following things will be programmed :
1. Making a list
2. Using the pop command
3. Using the append command 
## Step
1.  Open [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Open a new file
3. Save it with extension '.py' 
4. Type the following into the file
 
```python
list = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print("The list is ", list)
a = "strawberry"
list.append(a)
print(a)
list.pop(2)
print(list)
```
## What is done in code
In the first line a list is created in a variable. Second, the list is printed. Third there is another string variabe ```a``` . Then ```list.append``` is called with the argument ```a```. Next he variable ```a``` is printed. Then ```list.pop``` is called that removes an item form an list with an argument 2 that is the position of the item to be removed. At the end the final list id printed.
