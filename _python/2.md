# Session 2 
## Introduction

1. Taking string input 
2. returning the taken input 
3. concatinate in the print function

## Step

1.  Open Visual Code
2. Open a new file
3. Save it with extension  '.py'
4. Type the following into the file

```python
name = input("Enter your name : ")
print("Hello", name)
```
## What is done in the code
In the first sentence the input function is called, as input function returns the taken input given by the user, we need to store it in order to print. Here it is being stored in the variable 'name'.
In the second line of code, the print funtion is called and the it prints is 'Hello' and the variable name by concatinating the string and the values.
