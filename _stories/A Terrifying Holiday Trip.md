# A Terrifying Holiday Trip  

It was a nice and relaxing day. The Family of Dr. Reyansh Sharma had went out for a holiday trip to Ahmedabad and then to the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi — the city of Porbandar. Before reaching Porbandar, their trip had been delightful in Ahmedabad where they enjoyed their trip. After they settled in their luxurious room of the hotel that was situated in a remote place, Dr. Sharma decided to take bath in bathtub. When he entered the bathroom, he heard a very frightening sound which he ignored many times but the voice ‘khi-khi-khi-khi-come-come-come’ still came. He got frightened and screamed ‘Help! There is a gh...gh..gho..gho...ghost that is making weird noises in the bath....’. Thereafter, his wife Mrs. Sharma, screamed and fell on the ground, for she had fainted. Just after, their son Ronal ran to him and got to know that he had fainted too! 

Ronak, called hotel employees and asked for help. 

The employees who came for helping the family, also got shocked and ran away after entering the bathroom and hearing the noise. Then Ronak ran to the hotel intercom and called the hotel manager, who also got fainted after hearing the voice. Ronak being a strong child took rounds of the hotel and called many people from which most of them ran out the hotel after hearing the sound. Then Ronak found the plumber of the hotel and called him to his room. 

When the plumber was about to faint, Ronak gave him glass of water which stopped the him from fainting. When they both entered the bathroom, they fortunately were able to catch the ghost, 

The Ghost wasn’t a ghost, it was just the bathtub’s faucet that was left open from many days by the previous visitors of the room and the water tank gradually emptied. The faucet was stuck and couldn’t be turned off, and air had been passing through it which made the ' khi-khi-khi-khi-come-come-come‘ sound .The plumber was able to fix the faucet. 

His parents were given first aid and woke up. 

The family then enjoyed the vacation and went back to their home place. This experience was frightening as well as funny.
