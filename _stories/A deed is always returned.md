# A deed is always returned

Vaidji's house was in an old building. He lived in the back and opened a clinic in the front. His wife was in the habit of writing down the essentials of the day in a letter before opening the clinic. Vaidji would sit on his seat and first take the name of God and then open the letter .

Looking at the price of the things that the wife has written, then calculating it. Then praying to God that "O God! I have left your devotion only according to your command and am sitting here in the circle of worldliness." He never asked for a fee from any patient out of his own mouth. Some gave, some did not, but one thing was for sure, The vaid had enough money to buy the essentials of the day, then he did not take money for medicine from anyone, no matter how rich the patient was!

One day the vaid opened the clinic. Sitting on his seat, remembering God, He opened the letter with the necessary things to calculate the money and remained watching. After flour, dal and rice, the wife wrote that her daughter's wedding is on the 20th —— her dowry. After writing the price of the rest for a while, he wrote in front of the dowry, This work belongs to God.

One or two patients came. While they were given medicines, a luxorious car stopped in front of his clinic. The doctor paid special attention as many car owners used to come to him. Both patients took the medicine and left. A gentleman got out of the car and sat down on the seat. The doctor said that if you want to take medicine, come here on a stool to see the pulse and if you have to take it for someone else, describe the condition of the disease.

"Vaidji! You don't recognize me", he said ,"My name is Krishnalal. I came to your clinic before 15-16 years. Let me tell you about the last visit, then you will remember everything. When I first came here I did not come myself but God bless you"
