# A deed is always returned

Vaidji's house was in an old building. He lived in the back and kept the clinic in the front. His wife was in the habit of writing down the essentials of the day in a letter before opening the hospital. Vaidji would sit on the throne and first take the name of God and then open the letter .

Looking at the price of the things that the wife has written, then calculating it. Then praying to God that O God! I have left your devotion only according to your command and am sitting here in the circle of worldliness. He never asked for a fee from any patient out of his own mouth. Some gave, some did not, but one thing was for sure, Javoj had enough money to buy the essentials of the day, then he did not take money for medicine from anyone, no matter how rich the patient was! *

One day the doctor opened the hospital. Sitting on the cushion, remembering God, Ekitas opened the letter with the necessary things to calculate the money and remained watching. Once his mind wandered. He saw stars shining in front of his eyes but soon he took control of his nerves. After flour, dal and rice, the wife wrote that her daughter's wedding is on the 20th, her dowry. After writing the price of the rest for a while, he wrote in front of the dowry, This work belongs to God, God knows. 

One or two patients came. They were being medicated. Meanwhile, a luxorious car stopped in front of his hospital. The doctor paid special attention as many car owners used to come to him. Both patients took the medicine and left. A gentleman got out of the car and saluted and sat down on the bench. The doctor said that if you want to take medicine, come here on a stool to see the pulse and if you have to take it for someone else, describe the condition of the disease.

He started saying sir, Vaidji! You don't recognize me My name is Krishnalal. Yes ... where can you recognize me? Because I came to your hospital after 15-16 years. Let me tell you about the last visit, then you will remember everything. When I first came here I did not come myself but God bless you
